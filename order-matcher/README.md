# IntegrumSwap Mathcing Engine

### How to run

Build Rust contract (Stylus)
```
cargo stylus check -e https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
```

Deploy OrderMatcher Rust contract
```
cargo stylus deploy --private-key=$PRIV_KEY -e https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
```

### Arbitrum Stylus

IntegrumSwap uses Arbitrum Stylus to implement an order matching engine to which all the limit and market orders are sent. It is written as a smart contract in Rust.
So what if we reach the limit that Arbitrum Stylus supports through itâ€™s WASM VM? It should be easy to implement sharding with multiple matching engines each taking care of a slice of the orderbook.

The OrderMatching contract is implemented here.
